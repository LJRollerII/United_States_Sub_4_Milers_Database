# Introduction
The mile (5,280 ft, 1,760 yd, 8 furlongs, or 1,609 m) is a unit of distance that originating from the Latin phrase "mille passus‚Äù, meaning one thousand paces.  Overtime this distance became a popular sport for foot racing (Which will eventually be known as Athletics/Track & Field globally) and produced some of Track and Field's earliest distance stars such as Walter George. The mile has become one of the most recognized races and is now the only non-metric track event that the international and U.S. federations, World Athletics and USA Track & Field, officially recognize as a record distance, due to its legacy and prestige. There's special appeal that draws people to the mile, and it has one of the difficult milestones for an athlete to achieve in any sport, which is to run it in under four minutes.

This task was once thought physically impossible until May of 1954 when Roger Bannister of England became the first person to run under four minutes with a time of 3:59.4. Since then, approximately 1,600 people have joined this exclusive club cementing their legacy as an all-time elite middle-distance / distance runner.

Running under four minutes in the mile is a milestone every middle-distance and distance runner wishes to accomplish throughout their career. In the United States, as of June 14th 2022 there are 659 American that run under 4 minutes in the mile.
